    <h1>Welcome to Accent Press!</h1>
    <p>Since we've had a lot of people tell us that they can't figure out how to use it, we've made this page to help!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the settings, and choose which languages you want. This tells the extension which accents to enable or not.</li>
      <li>Select the speed. The higher the speed, the more time it takes for the accents to switch (We're working on something more intuitive, don't worry!)</li>
      <li>To type an accent, hold down the <strong>physical</strong> key on your keyboard (for example, the <code>E</code> key to type Ã©). Type as you would normally, just hold down the accents longer than normal.</li>
    </ol>
